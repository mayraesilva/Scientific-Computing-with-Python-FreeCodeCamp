#In this project, you will solve the mathematical puzzle 
# known as the Tower of Hanoi. 
# The puzzle consists of three rods and 
# a number of disks of different diameters.


rods = {
    'A': list(range(3, 0, -1),
    'B': [],
    'C': []
    }

# You can move only top-most disks
# You can move only one disk at a time
# You cannot place larger disks on top of smaller ones
